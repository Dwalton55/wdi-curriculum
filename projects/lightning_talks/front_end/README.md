# Front End Lightning Talks

Your goal is to create an exceedingly brief presentation of a popular front-end library or framework (~5 min). We encourage you to try to do a live demo / have a working code example. Please also [create a brief github gist](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-gists/) (or "cheat sheet") for your fellow developers, outlining your findings, and linking to any helpful tutorials, resources, hints, and tips you discover in your research. After your presentation, we really recommend you to publicly share your lightning talk online.  Writing blogs and creating content is a fantastic way to get your name out in the community.

You should aim to answer the following questions:

- What problem does the library solve?
- How do you use it?
