# React Refresh!

It's been a few weeks since the last time we built a UI using React.  This morning, use `create-react-app` to build a basic ToDo list.

Requirements:

  - Iterate through a list of JSON data and show the todo in the browser.
  - Wire up an input to add a todo item to the list.
  - Add a checkbox that a user can click once a todo is finished to remove it from the list.

Stretch Goals:

  - When clicking on a todo item, the user is navigated to a `show` page.

  - Use `semantic-ui-react` to style the todo list. (Docs Page Here: https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction)

Sample todo data:

```
{
  "todos": [{
    "task": "clean room",
  }, {
    "task": "read books",
  }, {
    "task": "buy groceries",
  }, {
    "task": "meal prep",
  }, {
    "task": "master react again",
  }]
}
```
