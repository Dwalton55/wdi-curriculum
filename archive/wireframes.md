## How to Start

### The Discovery Process: donâ€™t get caught up in design, features, ux. Make sure you understand the project. Do research and make sure you know what you are building
	- Who is the owner?
	- What is important to the owner?
	- Who is the audience?
	- What is important to the audience?

### Features:
	- Not yet wire framing
	- High level what are the features we need in order to satisfy the owner and audience
	- This is where you start writing your user stories

### Wireframes:
	- High level structure and layout of your site.
	- Keep mobile responsiveness in mind
	- Build out high level views of all screens
	- Make notes of all interactions on the page
	- Best to do this on Pen and Paper/Sketch/Figma
	- Give direction of the experience of that page
	- This process will guide you into further understanding your product

### Visual Design (more design heavy, you may skip over this if you want):
	- Take the wireframes and ideas that you have been working through and iterate through them and polish the wireframes into something closer to what you want to build in real life.
	- This is generally where images, fonts, and other assets become more finalized.
	- Typically done by the designer
