Create and present another student's elevator pitch -- Include =>
  - Name
  - How did you get here (previous jobs, reason for coming to GA)
  - What do you hope to do with your WDI skills?
  - Who is your hero and why? (a parent, a celebrity, an influential person in one’s life)


## Emotional Framing
- Programming is not about learning a sequence of steps, it's about developing a mindset to solve problems and think programmatically.
- Language not important
    - critical/analytical/programatic thinking.
    - don't memorize, conceptualize ideas.
        - the internet is your notebook/memory
    - be able to adapt quickly
- Deal with chaos in your head. Being confused/lost is NORMAL. No one pays you because you know all the answers. The job is about jumping into confusion and being able to find a solution.
- Development can be very personal
    - Debugging your own mistakes
    - Being a good "Googler" and reading tech documents takes practice
    - You learn more by doing than by listening
    - Failure happens.  Failure allows you to learn and grow.  Lean into it.
- ERRORS are GOOD
- Hard Work: 80-90hrs/wk minimum
- The maximum point of learning is right at the edge of learning and panic.

## Team Norming

Values, House Rules, and Logistics

- Values are: emotional, ways to think, mind sets, perspectives
  Examples:
  - **Be Bold** - Don't hold ideas in, share with the group
  - **Honesty over Politeness** - Tell a team mate about stinky breath rather than festering on it all day
- House Rules are: Dos and Don'ts, preemptively avoid pet peeves
  - No microwaving fish
  - No cell phones during team meetings
- Logistics are: how and when to do things, largely decided by instructors during the course
  - Working hours 9-5
  - Stand ups 9:50

## Classroom Culture

- Open safe environment
- Take ownership of your experience
- Check your ego at the door
- Empathy
- Don't compare yourself to others, compare yourself to who you were yesterday
- You get what you put in

## Mentorship Culture

- Take care of each other.
- Benchmark only against yourself; some are good at one thing, others at another. 
- Leverage each other's strengths.
- Prove your understanding by teaching others.
- Your classmates will be the best foundation for establishing a professional network in tech!
- Your classmates will be your number one best resource!
  - During projects
  - After class hours
  - COLLABORATE!!

## Feedback

The WDI classroom culture is firmly rooted in a cycle of `constant`, `constructive`, and `actionable` feedback. These feedback loops go both ways, from General Assembly to our students and from students back to General Assembly.

#### Constant

`Constant` feedback is given as often as possible. We believe in detecting problems as early as possible, and working through them before they grow into larger issues.

Some ways that we implement these constant feedback loops at GA include:

- An open classroom environment: We expect the classroom environment to involve constant discussion and questioning. 
- Daily stand-up meetings: The primary purpose of these daily meetings is to check in and look for patterns in our learning trajectory. 
- Weekly exit tickets: These are a weekly opportunity for the students to give us longer-form feedback.
- NPS Surveys: These are even longer-form surveys that will be given a few times throughout the course.

#### Constructive

We expect that any feedback given is `constructive`. We don't believe that `constructive` feedback always has to be "positive". Whether something is going well or course-correction is needed, `constructive` feedback is specific and detailed and indicates this clearly. It is not an emotional response, but a genuine observation of behaviors that should be re-inforced or changed. Let's look at some examples and non-examples of "constructive" feedback:

  **Example:** Instructor: "There is some duplication in your CSS. Consolidating the duplicated classes would make the code a lot cleaner."  
  **Non-example:** Instructor: "Your CSS is a mess."  

  **Example:** Instructor: "Your User Stories are extremely detailed. Keep it up!"  
  **Non-example:** Instructor: "Looks good."  

  **Example:** Student: "This lecture didn't work particularly well for me because I needed more visual examples."  
  **Non-example:** Student: "I hated today's lecture."  
  
  **Example:** Student: "Pair-programming really helped me make sense of this lab."    
  **Non-example:** Student: "Everything went fine."  
  
#### Actionable

We also expect that our `constructive` feedback is `actionable`. `Actionable` feedback is both `possible` to implement and also `timely`. `Possible` means that it is something we can reasonably accomplish, and `timely` means that we can finish it within a reasonable amount of time. Our goal should be to set up `constructive` goals that we can actually accomplish within a day. When we do this, we will ensure that we are accomplishing a set of meaningful goals every day. 

A good test for whether or not a goal is `actionable` is to check that it includes both a small, specific action and a soon-to-come end time. Let's look at some examples and non-examples:

  **Example:** Instructor: "We're going to master for-loops today."  
  **Non-example:** Instructor: "We're going to be really good at JavaScript."   

  **Example:** Student: "I want to master flexbox this afternoon."  
  **Non-example:** Student: "I want to feel better about CSS."  

## Plagiarism
### Statement

General Assembly takes academic honesty very seriously, and as such will not tolerate any student who plagiarizes in order to satisfy class requirements.  Programs at General Assembly are intensive, require a lot of work on the part of the student, and students will occasionally not be able to complete work in a timely fashion.

Rather than rely on work that’s not your own to create the appearance of success, let your instructional team know as early as possible that you are not prepared for the work.  It is much easier to come up with a plan, than it is to succeed if you’ve been removed from the program.

### Definition

Plagiarism is the act of claiming that work that does not belong to you is in fact your own.  It can take many forms, and each concentration at General Assembly will have a slightly different guideline to identify plagiarism in their field.

Generally it is safe to assume that if you are including work that does not belong to you in an effort to build on your own work — cite it.  If you are using work that does not belong to you as a replacement for your own work, you’re probably plagiarizing.

Plagiarism can unintentionally occur.  While it is fine to use outside sources, if **all** or **most** of your code (specifically logic/JS/Ruby) is from other git repos/videos/blog posts, you are in violation of the plagiarism rules cited above.  If you do use outside resources, make sure you **cite** those resources in your README.md file.

### Procedure

If an instructor is in doubt of a students work or has evidence of plagiarism, the student will be asked to justify the work they've submitted. This often is in the context of making you explain your code line by line. Should they be unable to show the work they have claimed as their own is in fact theirs, the student will face disciplinary action.

Instances of plagiarism will be evaluated on a case by case basis, but will most likely result in removal from the program

## Stand-Up

- Yesterday (What's been a win since your last Standup?)
- Blockers (What is something you'd like to see again since your last standup? What is still challenging you?)
- Today's wins (What would you like to accomplish today?)
- `Stand-ups should focus on generating ACTIONABLE goals for each day.`
- More info here (We will review this tomorrow)

## Common Student Worries
1. I'm making a lot of mistakes
2. Imposter syndrome
3. I don't "do" math
4. What's the best practice? Finding the one "correct" answer
    - Best practices change constantly and from company to company
    - If you think properly, you'll probably naturally arrive at a best practice
    - All that matters is "Does it work?"
        - Use your time to learn new technology or strengthen your problem solving
5. Having a perfect understanding of everything
    - Class is set up to accommodate students of all abilities
        - Scaffolded lecture notes, homework, and projects
    - We make sure you understand at least the most important concepts
6. Having an amazing portfolio/completing all assignments
        - what matters is the ability to think
    - don't worry about completing every lab/homework
        - they're there as an exercise in thinking
        - completing and sleeping for 2 hours is worse than sleeping and not completing
7. Asking the instructional team questions
    - For lecture and labs, ask questions constantly
    - For Homework, queue up with the evening TA
        - This will force you to do some debugging on your own, but it will also give you a quick resource if you're stuck
    - Projects is your time to see what the real world will be like
        - the more time you spend fixing, the more you learn
        - receiving an answer stops the learning process
        - only ask a question if you've been stuck for about a day
