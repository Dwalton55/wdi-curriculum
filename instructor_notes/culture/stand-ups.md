# Stand-Ups

Every morning for the rest of our time together, we will have a stand-up meeting. These meeting are going to help us accomplish a few key goals in this class:

1. These meetings will give us a daily opportunity to close feedback loops and check in on our learning progress and expectations.
2. These meetings will allow us to set up meaningful, actionable goals for ourselves every day.
3. These meetings will allow us to share knowledge every day throughout the class.

## Why is it called a "stand-up?"

The simple answer is that you stand during the meeting.

The more important answer is that the meeting should be so short that you won't need to sit down. The goal of a stand-up is to quickly check in as a team, without over-analyzing anything in particular.

## How does it work?

In this class, we will do a slightly modified version of a traditional stand-up meeting. We'll run the meeting in two phases: 

1. A traditional 5-minute stand-up, led by you, the students.
2. A "meta-standup" led by an instructor, where we synthesize some larger goals from each individual stand-up's output.

### Traditional Stand-up

You will be split up into small groups for each unit of this class. Each morning, your group will gather and answer three questions:

1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What is a "blocker" from yesterday that I am still struggling with?
3. What (actionable) goal I hope to accomplish today?

> REMEMBER: "Blockers" are best communicated in a constructive way. Saying "I don't feel confident with yesterday's material" is good to know, but saying "I wish I could get some more practice with if-statements" is much easier to address directly!

Once your team has gone around and answered these questions individually, you will come together and select one meaningful, actionable goal that your group would like to focus on for the day.

### The Meta-Standup

Once your team has come up with a single goal for the day, we will go around the room and put each team's goal on the board.

This process will let us set the tone for the day and make sure we are accomplishing at least 2-3 meaningful goals every single day. This also sets up an easy way for us to track our progress as a class.


## Stand-Up

- Yesterday (What's been a win since your last Standup?)
- Blockers (What is something you'd like to see again since your last standup? What is still challenging you?)
- Today's wins (What would you like to accomplish today?)
- `Stand-ups should focus on generating ACTIONABLE goals for each day.`

## Feedback

The WDI classroom culture is firmly rooted in a cycle of `constant`, `constructive`, and `actionable` feedback. These feedback loops go both ways, from General Assembly to our students and from students back to General Assembly.

#### Constant

`Constant` feedback is given as often as possible. We believe in detecting problems as early as possible, and working through them before they grow into larger issues.

Some ways that we implement these constant feedback loops at GA include:

- An open classroom environment: We expect the classroom environment to involve constant discussion and questioning. 
- Daily stand-up meetings: The primary purpose of these daily meetings is to check in and look for patterns in our learning trajectory. 
- Weekly exit tickets: These are a weekly opportunity for the students to give us longer-form feedback.
- NPS Surveys: These are even longer-form surveys that will be given a few times throughout the course.

#### Constructive

We expect that any feedback given is `constructive`. We don't believe that `constructive` feedback always has to be "positive". Whether something is going well or course-correction is needed, `constructive` feedback is specific and detailed and indicates this clearly. It is not an emotional response, but a genuine observation of behaviors that should be re-inforced or changed. Let's look at some examples and non-examples of "constructive" feedback:

  **Example:** Instructor: "There is some duplication in your CSS. Consolidating the duplicated classes would make the code a lot cleaner."  
  **Non-example:** Instructor: "Your CSS is a mess."  

  **Example:** Instructor: "Your User Stories are extremely detailed. Keep it up!"  
  **Non-example:** Instructor: "Looks good."  

  **Example:** Student: "This lecture didn't work particularly well for me because I needed more visual examples."  
  **Non-example:** Student: "I hated today's lecture."  
  
  **Example:** Student: "Pair-programming really helped me make sense of this lab."    
  **Non-example:** Student: "Everything went fine."  
  
#### Actionable

We also expect that our `constructive` feedback is `actionable`. `Actionable` feedback is both `possible` to implement and also `timely`. `Possible` means that it is something we can reasonably accomplish, and `timely` means that we can finish it within a reasonable amount of time. Our goal should be to set up `constructive` goals that we can actually accomplish within a day. When we do this, we will ensure that we are accomplishing a set of meaningful goals every day. 

A good test for whether or not a goal is `actionable` is to check that it includes both a small, specific action and a soon-to-come end time. Let's look at some examples and non-examples:

  **Example:** Instructor: "We're going to master for-loops today."  
  **Non-example:** Instructor: "We're going to be really good at JavaScript."   

  **Example:** Student: "I want to master flexbox this afternoon."  
  **Non-example:** Student: "I want to feel better about CSS."
