# Stand-Ups

Every morning for the rest of our time together, we will have a stand-up meeting. These meeting are going to help us accomplish a few key goals in this class:

1. These meetings will give us a daily opportunity to close feedback loops and check in on our learning progress and expectations.
2. These meetings will allow us to set up meaningful, actionable goals for ourselves every day.
3. These meetings will allow us to share knowledge every day throughout the class.

## Why is it called a "stand-up?"

The simple answer is that you stand during the meeting.

The more important answer is that the meeting should be so short that you won't need to sit down. The goal of a stand-up is to quickly check in as a team, without over-analyzing anything in particular.

## How does it work?

In this class, we will do a slightly modified version of a traditional stand-up meeting. We'll run the meeting in two phases: 

1. A traditional 5-minute stand-up, led by you, the students.
2. A "meta-standup" led by an instructor, where we synthesize some larger goals from each individual stand-up's output.

### Traditional Stand-up

You will be split up into small groups for each unit of this class. Each morning, your group will gather and answer three questions:

1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What is a "blocker" from yesterday that I am still struggling with?
3. What (actionable) goal I hope to accomplish today?

> REMEMBER: "Blockers" are best communicated in a constructive way. Saying "I don't feel confident with yesterday's material" is good to know, but saying "I wish I could get some more practice with if-statements" is much easier to address directly!

Once your team has gone around and answered these questions individually, you will come together and select one meaningful, actionable goal that your group would like to focus on for the day.

### The Meta-Standup

Once your team has come up with a single goal for the day, we will go around the room and put each team's goal on the board.

This process will let us set the tone for the day and make sure we are accomplishing at least 2-3 meaningful goals every single day. This also sets up an easy way for us to track our progress as a class.
